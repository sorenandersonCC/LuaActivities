    Numbers Game: Campers create a program that 
    chooses a random number between 1 and 100 to
     be guessed. The program tells campers if
      their guess is too high or too low. (numGame)

    Purpose: Practice in everything theyâ€™ve learned 
    so far (variables to store answers and random 
    number, loops to continuously run the program, 
    conditionals to determine if the player is too high, 
    too low, or has won
